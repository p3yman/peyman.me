    <p>
      As you know, I'm a software developer with over a decade of experience in
      the tech industry. I've been lucky to work on some fantastic projects and
      collaborate with brilliant minds. I also had experience in teaching and
      mentoring developers in the past. Now, I'd love to give back to the
      community by offering free mentoring sessions in a more structured way.
    </p>

    <h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Community Support</strong>: I wouldn't be where I am without the

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Diverse Perspectives</strong>: I believe that everyone brings
        something unique to the table. I love learning from others as much as
        sharing my own experiences.

      <li>
        <strong>Transparency</strong>: Moving to a new country, navigating
        career changes, or breaking into tech can be confusing. I've been
        through it all, and I want to offer you a no-nonsense approach to
        tackling these challenges.

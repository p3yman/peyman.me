As humans we love to separate things, put it in a box and label it. We do that every second of our life. "Most people thing X", "This product is not good because I don't know anyone who use it", or even "Don't ever do that, I tried once and it didn't work!".

I don't have problem with this form of explaining things as long as it's expressing opinions. But when we start to convince people based on some illusion around a topic, it can be harmful. When we know only this form of convincing, we don't think how much others can count on that and waste money and time.

Have you ever felt like an NPC on your team?

You know what I mean: an NPC. A Non-Playable Character. If you're into gaming (I'm not btw üòÅ), you instantly get the image. A character that wanders around, repeating the same lines, doing things that don‚Äôt really matter, just existing to support the main players. Sadly, sometimes this isn't just in games. Sometimes, it happens in our jobs, too.

I've heard this from people who take my [mentoring sessions](/mentoring) and I've seen this happen in teams, where passion and creativity initially burn bright. You start off excited about the project, the product vision, and all the amazing things you can build. But then, slowly, you realize something disturbing: your ideas don't actually move the needle. Decisions happen above your head, conversations skip past your contributions, they say they hear you but then nothing, and gradually you realize you're treated like a prop, not a key player.

## Why Does This Happen?

This doesn't usually come from bad intentions. Teams often start with a clear mission and energy, but as projects scale, or they fail a couple of times, hierarchies solidify, and suddenly fewer people are making the real decisions. Managers think they need to take over without actually understanding what is the problem. They don't see they are losing people and not projects. What's next? You can suggest ideas in meetings, passionately argue for changes, but eventually realize decisions are already made. Your role, frustratingly, feels reduced to simply executing tasks someone else handed down.

## From Passionate to Powerless

The worst part? It‚Äôs not instant. It creeps in gradually, bit by bit, chipping away at your enthusiasm until one day you realize you‚Äôve stopped caring. You used to love digging into code, collaborating on new designs, and dreaming big about features. Now you find yourself just clocking in, knocking out tickets, and clocking outŸà like an NPC mechanically going through the motions.

This isn't about ego or needing to be the center of attention. It's about feeling that what you do matters. Humans, especially those in creative fields like tech, design, and product management, thrive when they see their work making a real impact. Take that away, and we lose motivation fast.

## Signs You're Becoming an NPC

Not sure if you're on your way to become an NPC? Here are some telltale signs that you might be sliding into NPC territory:

- Your ideas are rarely considered or discussed seriously.

- You hear major product decisions only after they're finalized.

- You're not involved in strategic conversations or the bigger picture.

- Praise and attention go to a select few "key players". Specially those who are fixing the problems they made themselves!

- You feel interchangeable, easily replaceable.

Sound familiar? Don‚Äôt worry; you're not alone.

## Managers: You Have a Responsibility

Managers, team leads, and executives, listen up!

Often, this NPC phenomenon isn't the employee's fault. It‚Äôs usually a symptom of your team's culture. If your team members feel sidelined, undervalued, and like their contributions don't matter, the responsibility lies with you.

Great leaders don't just delegate tasks, they empower their teams. What you can do to avoid turning passionate people into NPCs? Here's what I suggest:

- Create Transparent Communication: Include your team in strategic decisions, and communicate clearly about how and why these decisions are made.

- Celebrate Contributions Publicly: Recognize everyone's impact, not just the obvious "stars." Small acknowledgments go a long way.

- Ensure Real Engagement: Actively seek input, and not just superficially. Make sure team members genuinely feel their voices matter.

- Check Your Culture Regularly: Routinely ask your team how they‚Äôre feeling. Act quickly if you sense morale dipping.

- If your culture continuously converts main players into NPCs, you'll lose your best people. Good talent doesn't stay where they're not valued.

## Breaking Out of NPC Mode

If you're feeling this way, it's important to realize your feelings are valid and common. While ideally, your managers should recognize and fix these issues, you don‚Äôt have to stay stuck as an NPC. Here's what I think you can do to start reclaiming your impact:

- Speak Up Clearly: Try to understand why decisions aren't coming from collaborations. Be direct about wanting more involvement. Sometimes managers aren‚Äôt aware they're sidelining people.

- Focus on Influence, Not Just Tasks: Try to get involved in discussions earlier in the process. Ask questions about why decisions are made, even if you're not directly invited.

- Build Alliances: Talk to teammates who feel similarly. Collective voices are harder to ignore than single ones.

- Reignite Your Passion: If your current role truly won‚Äôt change, consider shifting projects, teams, or even companies. Life‚Äôs too short to spend your days as a background character.

## From NPC to Main Character

Nobody starts their career wanting to fade into the background. The goal is to feel excited and impactful about your work. If you‚Äôre slipping into NPC territory, pause and take action. The tech world is vast, full of opportunities to truly contribute and matter.

**Remember, you deserve a role that feels meaningful. Don‚Äôt settle for being just another NPC. You‚Äôre the main character of your career‚Äîstart acting like it!**
